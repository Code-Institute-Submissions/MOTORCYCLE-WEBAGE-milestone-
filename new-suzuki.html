                                The K5 GSX-R750 engine was selected for the GSX-S750 due to its mounting angle, which is
                                closer to vertical than the current GSX-R750 engine, and helps achieve the short wheelbase
                                desired in a naked machine. The GSX-S750 boasts more power and torque than the outgoing GSR750,
                                with peak power increased to 114PS at 10,500rpm and torque upped to 81Nm at 9,000rpm. This
                                has been possible by the change to new, 10-hole, long-nose fuel injectors from the older
                                8-hole design on the GSR. The GSX-S also gets a new air box and exhaust.
