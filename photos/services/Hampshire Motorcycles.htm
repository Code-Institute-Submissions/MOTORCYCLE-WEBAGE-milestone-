                <p> Gsxr 1000Both the GSX-R1000 and GSX-R1000R utilise an all-new, 999.8cc inline four-cylinder engine, which uses Suzuki Racing Variable
                Valve Timing (SR-VVT) and a new finger follower valve train as part of Suzuki’s Broad Power System. Developed for use on
                the firm’s GSX-RR MotoGP racer, the system allows the new engine to produce strong low-midrange power, before the SR-VVT
                boosts top-end output. Suzuki’s SR-VVT is a compact and lightweight mechanical system, that is built into the intake sprocket
                and is activated by centrifugal force, while the new finger-follower valve train is 6g lighter than a conventional bucket/tappet
                system, and allows the engine to rev higher and increases top-end power, with reliability. Inside the engine there are new
                pistons, pins, and rings, as well as new camshafts and titanium valves for higher peak power. Top-feed injectors, located
                on top of the air box, and new ride-by-wire throttle bodies also help boost peak power and allow for more efficient combustion
                and precise fuelling control, while servo-operated exhaust valves in the exhaust balance tubes remain closed in the low and
                midrange, opening in the higher rev range to increase top-end power, again without compromising on the low-midrange. Careful
                thought and planning also went into the engine’s dimensions and layout, to enhance the bike’s cornering performance. The
                cylinder block incline angle is moved backwards by 6 degrees, reducing the engine length by 22.2mm, the benefits of which
                are increased front-end feel and increased stability. The new GSX-R1000 also gets a redesigned slipper clutch for easier
                deceleration and a lighter lever pull, and a new cooling system, with a high-efficiency curved radiator and dual electric
                fans.</p>

                <p> Gsx-s125</p>
                <p> Gsx-s750 Following the launch of the GSX-S1000 last year, which is powered by the revered GSX-R1000 K5 engine, Suzuki has added a
                new GSX-S750 to its naked street bike lineup, this time using the same engine architecture as the K5 power-plant from the
                iconic GSX-R750. The K5 GSX-R750 engine was selected for the GSX-S750 due to its mounting angle, which is closer to vertical
                than the current GSX-R750 engine, and helps achieve the short wheelbase desired in a naked machine. The GSX-S750 boasts more
                power and torque than the outgoing GSR750, with peak power increased to 114PS at 10,500rpm and torque upped to 81Nm at 9,000rpm.
                This has been possible by the change to new, 10-hole, long-nose fuel injectors from the older 8-hole design on the GSR. The
                GSX-S also gets a new air box and exhaust. Enabling riders to open the throttle with greater confidence in a mix of conditions
                is the addition of a three-mode traction control system. The system continuously monitors front and rear wheel speeds, the
                throttle position, crank position, and gear position, and when a slide is detected, reduces engine output to deliver smooth,
                continuous drive. Suzuki’s easy-start system and low-rpm assist function that were seen on the GSX-S1000 are now featured
                on the GSX-S750. Chassis performance is improved with a new swingarm, and braking is enhanced with the addition of radial-mount
                calipers and new discs. The GSX-S750 is aggressively styled, in keeping with the GSX-S family, with sharp lines and angles,
                and a belly pan as standard fitment, and is set to arrive in dealerships early 2017.</p>
